# 170-Project


Rui Zhou : generate all possible cycles
Brady Wang : generate all possible TA locations + basic branch pruning
Alan He : given a car path, generate TA drop-off outputs + final score (total energy expenditure)

Future goals:
1. think about hard inputs -- ALL THREE MEMBERS
2. Linear regression / LP mindset -- Brady
3. advanced branch pruning -- Brady
4. ML/AI (deep learning, q-learning, etc.) -- Rui
5. MCMC (solving modified TSP, i.e. visit each vertex at least once) -- Alan
